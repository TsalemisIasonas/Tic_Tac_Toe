# Tic_Tac_Toe
A tic tac toe game versus the computer on the terminal. There are three different levels, easy, medium and hard:
On the easy level, the game is easily beatable, as the cpu moves are implemented by the python random module.
On medium, the computer recognizes if it can win or it has to block at the current move.
On hard, it implements strategies based on the opponent's moves.
